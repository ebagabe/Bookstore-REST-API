## Development of a Rest API with Express and MongoDB

- API: Application Programming Interface

- host is the domain of the server that will receive the request.

- user-agent: identifies the client, for example, data from the browser from which the request is coming.

- Content-Type: is the format of the data being sent in the body of the request, for example JSON, string.

- Authorization: are the authentication credentials for accessing protected resources.

- Accept: specifies the expected return format in the response, for example, JSON.

- Body: data sent by the client is transmitted to be received by the server, normally used for more structured data and in POST, PUT or PATCH requests. The data type sent by the body must be the same as that specified in the Content-Type, for example, application/json.

- Parameters are inserted into the URL to send specific data, which are widely used, for example, to send variable information such as search terms, IDs.

- HTTP method, among those accepted by the route, specifies the type of operation requested by the client. The most common are the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods.
